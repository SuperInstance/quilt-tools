// Referral Graph — seed v1 (Casey 12:03 mandate, PoC).
//
// One sheet, three repos seeded: quilt-tools <-> quilt-show <-> quilt-arcade.
// Honesty note (the PoC's first finding): at seed time ZERO edges carry the
// mandate's currency — a merged PR IN THE TARGET repo citing the technique.
// quilt-show has no merged PRs at all (episodes direct-pushed); quilt-arcade's
// merged PRs cite the quilt-main playtest report, not a seeded-repo technique.
// So every real edge is PENDING with provenance (where the finding lives).
// The mesh starts by measuring what speculation cannot buy.
//
// Weight law: PENDING = 0.05 (speculation is cheap) / VERIFIED = 1.0 (a
// merged PR in the to-node's repo cites the from-technique).
//
// Each edge carries its kill switch: falsification_condition — the observed
// evidence string that would refute the claim (probe() books the death as a
// REFUSED row; the scar stays in the graph).
