// One sheet, three repos seeded: quilt-tools <-> quilt-show <-> quilt-arcade.
// Honesty note (the PoC's first finding): at seed time ZERO edges carry the
// mandate's currency — a merged PR IN THE TARGET repo citing the technique.
// quilt-show has no merged PRs at all (episodes direct-pushed); quilt-arcade's
// merged PRs cite the quilt-main playtest report, not a seeded-repo technique.
// So every real edge is PENDING with provenance (where the finding lives).
// The mesh starts by measuring what speculation cannot buy.
//
// UPDATE 2026-09-26: the first edge earned currency. quilt-show PR #1
// ("E3 verification record: script<->sim claim map + referral edge to
// quilt-tools PR #3") MERGED 2026-09-25T19:14:08Z (merge a2f82a35) — a

// champion tiebreak (cites quilt-quant coin-toss-v1)") MERGED
// 2026-09-26T05:27:42Z (merge b14791f) — a merged PR in the to-node's repo

// ("docs: cite canonical opcode source (AI-Writings/algebra.md) in
